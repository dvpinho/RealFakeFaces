# Real-Fake faces (DeepFakes) Classification

This repository contains the project notebook that was developed during the Module #3 *Deep learning, computer vision and evolutionary computation* course by TDX | University of Coimbra [Data Science Academy](https://www.talkdesk.com/tdx/data-science-academy) (Powered by Talkdesk). Total course time was 80 hours plus 3 additional weeks for project related work.

For the project work and with the provided dataset, a real-fake face classifier was developed using several approaches: *convolutional neural networks* (CNN) and transfer learning with and without face cropping using the *Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks* (MTCNN).
